This is a set of python script to run simobserve() and symanalyze()
to make simulated MS and imaging.

# Files 
#########
README:
  This file
ACASimulation.py:
  Wrapping script for simobserve(). Basic parameters are given in
  param.py. 
ACAanalyze.py:
  Wrapping script for simanalyze(). The imaging method should be
  implemented in this script. Imaging will be done following ARC's
  recommendation. 
ACAanalyze2.py:
  Another version of ACAanalyze.py for imaging with CASA Guide method. 
param.py:
  Parameter file to control the simulation.
mkplot.py:
  Script to make fidelity vs model flux plot. 
dataCombineSimulation.pdf:
  Report and some description of this simulation script.

# How to use 
#########
1. Prepare your input FITS image. For M51 (fitsFile = 'M51ha.fits'),
   FITS file will be automatically downloaded.
2. Edit param.py for basic parameters. 
3. Run ACASimulation.py
   $ CASA <1>: execfile('ACASimulation.py')
   This will read param.py and execute simobserve() and then call
   ACAanalyze.py
4. To make fidelity vs model flux plot, run mkplot.py after setting
   proper project name in the script
   $ CASA <2>: execfile('mkplot.py')

In the default package, you can get simulation results for M51
only by running ACASimulation.py with any preparation.
