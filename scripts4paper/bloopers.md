# Bloopers and Lessons Learned

In preparation and parallel to an appendix we list here
some mistakes we (and you could) make and hopefully
help you identifying a wrong path.


## polka dot pattern

If your image seems to show a polka dot pattern, this can happen
on tclean with the weight of the total power visibilities too
high.  There are several ways to try and combat this:

1. bring the weight of the TPMS down
2. use multi-scale clean
3. use a smaller cycleniter to more often do a major cycle
4. use a more interactive clean

Under full disclosure, I have not tried all but the first option
