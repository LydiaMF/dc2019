1) M100 from casaguides
   --------------------

The https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/M100_Band3_Combine_5.4 casaguide walks you through
a feather combination. We will also try to provide this example for the other combination
methods.


To get the data, see also https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/M100_Band3#Obtaining_the_Data

For EA use:  https://alma-dl.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ftp/alma/sciver/
    EU use:  https://almascience.eso.org/almadata/sciver/
    NA use:  https://bulk.cv.nrao.edu/almadata/sciver/

For 12m use directory:     M100Band3_12m
For 7m/TP use directory:   M100Band3ACA

you will need the 12,, 7m and TP data, e.g. in NA (replace the stem of the URL with the EU/EA ones)

  wget https://bulk.cv.nrao.edu/almadata/sciver/M100Band3_12m/M100_Band3_12m_CalibratedData.tgz
  wget https://bulk.cv.nrao.edu/almadata/sciver/M100Band3ACA/M100_Band3_7m_CalibratedData.tgz
  wget https://bulk.cv.nrao.edu/almadata/sciver/M100Band3ACA/M100_Band3_ACA_ReferenceImages_5.1.tgz

This totals 24GB.


We are also planning on a trimmed version of these big data to immediately jump into data combination.

TP2VIS: https://github.com/tp2vis/distribute/blob/master/example1.md   needs to be updated

2) NGC 346 (SMC observatory project)
   ---------------------------------

NGC 346 (ALMA#2017.A.00054.S), the Observatory Project with PI: Claudia Agliozzi.

This is a ~15' map with 7m and TP data, lots of structure, demonstrates the need for combinations.

3) GMC fractal/powerspectrum (Koda)

http://admit.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/QAC/skymodel.fits    
http://admit.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/QAC/skymodel.ptg     
http://admit.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/QAC/qac_bench.tar.gz 

These is the old 4096 x 4096 models, there is a newer two part (Re/Im) model available
generated from Koda's newer code.  TBD.

4) Gaussian Models (Fomalont)


5) Outflow 

Outflow from Lupus 3 mms, I can include 12m, 7m, and TP, or just 7m
and TP.  This has been a relatively challenging data cube to "clean",
as I think the quality of the image will depend on turning the right
nobs in TCLEAN, maybe moreso than the actual combination.  But,
certainly an interesting emission structure. [AI] Contact: Adele

6) MC/GMC - apex + alma


7) LOFAR

(tentative) "Lower" frequency, possibly LOFAR.  [AI] Adele will
contact Pedro Salas to ask about this, and also follow up with the
LOFAR people who registered for the workshop (e.g. Kelley Hess, who
mentioned SKA HI pathfinder instruments and combination with SD
observations)
