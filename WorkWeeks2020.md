# *2020 Follow-up: Improving Image Fidelity on Astronomical Data *

## AIM

This is a follow-up of the
[DC2019](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2019/1179/info.php3?wsid=1179&venue=Oort)
workshop, and a sprint to make progress on the [Github](https://github.com/teuben/dc2019) page.
A lot of work has already been done, which should not be lost or forgotten, and some final coordination is needed to close out the [manuscript](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d829641216025000191a049).

Specific goals are (to be discussed with team):
* Return to manuscript draft, **before July 29**
* Develop specific tasks for each team, **July 29-31** 
* Share data/scripts, and test methods, **July 31-August 24**
* Develop publicly sharable code, **before August 24**
* Final hack-a-thon, **August 24-28**
* Robust manuscript draft, **end of August**

## FORMAT

We will dedicate two ''work weeks'' on July 29-31; and again August 24-28.  
We will tentatively plan on MEETING (virtually) at UTC 11-13.  These are mornings in the US (~7:00-9:00 EDT); afternoon in Europe (13:00-15:00); and night in Japan (20:00-22:00) and in Australia (21:00-23:00).  Outside of these hours, we dedicate some time each day to make progress on the agreed upon tasks.
I apologize that the hours are not convenient for Japan and Australia (and rather early in US). In case the times are a problem for anyone, we can send updates by email or/and Slack messages each day.

### Draft schedule:
* Wednesday 11-12 UT: General opening discussion, and each sub-team makes a 5 minute presentation (informal)
* Wednesday 12:10-13 UT: Make a 3-day plan with action-items
* Thursday 11-12 UT: Each sub-team gives a 5 minute update
* Thursday 12:10-13 UT: General discussion
* Friday 11-12 UT: Each sub-team gives a 5 minute update
* Friday 12:10-13 UT: Plan for August


### Preferred communication: 
Via Slack, datacomb2019.slack.com
