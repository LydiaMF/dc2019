# *2020 Follow-up: Improving Image Fidelity on Astronomical Data *

## AIM

This is a follow-up of the
[DC2019](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2019/1179/info.php3?wsid=1179&venue=Oort)
workshop, and a sprint to make progress on the [Github](https://github.com/teuben/dc2019) page.
A lot of work has already been done, which should not be lost or forgotten, and some final coordination is needed to close out the manuscript.

## FORMAT

We will dedicate two ``work weeks'' on July 29-31; and again August 24-28.  
We will tentatively plan on mornings (~7:00-9:00) in the US; afternoon in Europe (13:00-15:00); and night in Japan (20:00-22:00) and in Australia (21:00-23:00).  
I apologize that the hours are not convenient for Japan and Australia. In case the times are a problem for anyone, we can send updates by email and Slack messages each day.

## Participants: 

All leaders of the sub-teams, and active members who are testing methods and developing the manuscript draft.
